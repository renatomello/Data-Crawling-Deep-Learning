# Data-Crawling-Deep-Learning
Toy Model. Scrapy is used to create a crawler that extracts information about car model (Fiat Palio). Data is treated and then inserted in a Deep Neural Network (DNN) using TensorFlow and supervised learning. Finally, the DNN is able to predict the price of a Fiat Palio.
